# Charity Tracker Continuation Prompt - v2.1.19
## Last Updated: 2025-01-23

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE RULES ðŸš¨

### DATABASE FIELD USAGE
**THE `notes` FIELD IS ONLY FOR USER-ENTERED NOTES**
- NEVER store system data, JSON, or structured data in the notes field
- The notes field should ONLY contain text that the user typed in the notes input
- All donation data (miles_driven, stock_symbol, etc.) must be stored in their proper database columns
- The database has dedicated columns for all donation types - USE THEM

### PROPER DATA STORAGE
- miles_driven, mileage_rate, mileage_purpose â†’ Store in their respective columns
- stock_symbol, stock_quantity, fair_market_value â†’ Store in their respective columns
- crypto_symbol, crypto_quantity, crypto_type â†’ Store in their respective columns
- item_description, estimated_value â†’ Store in their respective columns
- notes â†’ ONLY for user's optional text notes about the donation

### LOCAL STORAGE USAGE RULES
**This is a multi-user database-driven application**
- localStorage should ONLY be used for:
  - User authentication tokens
  - User preferences (tax rate, profile)
  - Temporary UI state (not business data)
- NEVER use localStorage as primary data storage
- ALWAYS fetch fresh data from the database for:
  - Viewing donations
  - Editing donations
  - Calculating statistics
- localStorage copies of donations are for offline fallback ONLY

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL VERSIONING POLICY ðŸ”´
**EVERY deployment MUST use the automated version bump system**

### Version Bump Commands:
- `npm run bump:patch` - Bug fixes and small changes (most common)
- `npm run bump:minor` - New features
- `npm run bump:major` - Breaking changes

### What the bump script does automatically:
1. Updates package.json version
2. Updates version in ALL HTML files
3. Updates VERSION.json
4. Commits the version change
5. Pushes to GitHub for auto-deploy

**NEVER manually edit version numbers - ALWAYS use npm run bump:patch/minor/major**

## Recent Fixes (v2.1.18-19)
- Fixed API to use proper database columns instead of JSON in notes field
- Updated editDonation to fetch from API instead of localStorage
- Fixed field ID mismatches (stockQuantity vs stockShares)
- Added proper mileage_rate storage and retrieval for historical accuracy
- Cleaned up improper use of notes field for data storage

## Database Schema Reminder
The donations table has these dedicated columns:
- **Core**: id, user_id, charity_id, amount, date, donation_type, notes, receipt_url
- **Mileage**: miles_driven, mileage_rate, mileage_purpose
- **Stock**: stock_symbol, stock_quantity, fair_market_value
- **Crypto**: crypto_symbol, crypto_quantity, crypto_type
- **Items**: item_description, estimated_value (+ separate donation_items table)

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/donations - List all donations (includes all columns)
- GET /api/donations/{id} - Get single donation (includes all columns)
- POST /api/donations - Create donation (saves to proper columns)
- PUT /api/donations/{id} - Update donation (updates proper columns)
- DELETE /api/donations/{id} - Delete donation

## Testing Checklist
âœ… Mileage type displays as "mileage" not "X miles"
âœ… Miles field saves to miles_driven column
âœ… Edit donation fetches from database, not localStorage
âœ… Mileage rate is stored with each donation
âœ… Notes field only contains user-entered text
âœ… All donation types save to proper columns

## Known Issues
- Deployment requires manual Cloudflare dashboard updates
- Performance warning on delete (non-critical)

## Development Guidelines
1. ALWAYS use database columns for data storage
2. NEVER pack multiple fields into JSON in notes
3. Fetch fresh data from API for all operations
4. Use localStorage only for auth and preferences
5. Test with multiple users to ensure data isolation
6. Bump version on every deployment

## Deployment Instructions (AUTO-DEPLOY via GitHub)

### For Bug Fixes and Small Changes:
```bash
npm run bump:patch
```
This single command:
- Bumps version (e.g., 2.1.19 â†’ 2.1.20)
- Updates all files automatically
- Commits with message "Bump version to 2.1.20"
- Pushes to GitHub
- Triggers Cloudflare Pages auto-deployment

### For New Features:
```bash
npm run bump:minor
```

### For Breaking Changes:
```bash
npm run bump:major
```

### Deployment URLs:
- **Production**: https://charity-tracker-qwik.pages.dev
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/robpress123-png/charity-tracker-qwik
- **Cloudflare Dashboard**: Check deployment status

**NEVER:**
- Manually edit version numbers
- Use `wrangler deploy` directly
- Push without version bump

**ALWAYS:**
- Use npm run bump:patch/minor/major
- Wait for Cloudflare auto-deployment
- Test after deployment completes

## Files Structure
