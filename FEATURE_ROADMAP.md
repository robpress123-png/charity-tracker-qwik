## üìù Notes

The v4.6 demo file shows a mature, feature-rich application with comprehensive donation tracking capabilities. The current implementation has the foundation in place, and we should focus on building out the core donation and charity management features first, then gradually add the more advanced capabilities like crypto tracking and automated imports.
