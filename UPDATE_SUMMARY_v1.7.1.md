# Charity Tracker v1.7.1 - Update Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Database Migration for user_charities
- Created SQL migration script: `sql/fix_user_charities_is_approved.sql`
- Added missing `is_approved` column to user_charities table
- Created comprehensive migration commands documentation

### 2. ✅ Fixed Donation Count Mismatch
- **Issue**: Dashboard showing 42 donations instead of 76+
- **Fix**: Updated `dashboard.html` line 1944 to use `data.total` instead of `data.donations.length`
- Now correctly displays total donation count from database, not just current page

### 3. ✅ Fixed Search Function in Recent Donations
- **Issue**: Search filter not actually filtering displayed results
- **Fix**: Created `displayFilteredDonations()` function to properly show filtered results
- Search now works for charity name, notes, crypto symbols, and stock symbols
- Added type and month filters that work correctly

### 4. ✅ Fixed Admin Stats Calculations
- **Issue**: Donations by year and "this month" showing 0
- **Fix**: Updated `functions/api/admin/stats.js`:
  - Changed `donation_date` to `date` column (lines 62, 91)
  - Fixed monthly calculation to use current month pattern matching
- Stats now correctly show yearly breakdowns and monthly totals

### 5. ✅ Added Charity Verification Tool
- Created new API endpoint: `/api/charities/verify.js`
- Added "Verify" button next to charity selection in donation form
- Features:
  - Verifies charities against IRS 501(c)(3) database
  - Shows verification status with visual indicators
  - Provides suggestions for similar charity names
  - Auto-selects verified charities
  - Includes tips and warning signs for charity scams

### 6. ✅ Fixed "Loading charities" Message in Admin
- **Issue**: Charity count stuck on "Loading..." in admin dashboard
- **Fix**: Added `loadCharityCount()` call to window.onload function
- Charity count now loads properly on page load
