## Database Schema

### Key Tables
```sql
-- System charities (IRS verified)
charities (id, name, ein, category, address, city, state, zip_code, phone, website, description)

-- User personal charities
user_charities (id, user_id, name, ein, category, address, city, state, zip_code, phone, website, description, is_approved, created_at, updated_at)

-- Donations (linked by charity_id)
donations (id, user_id, charity_id, amount, date, notes, created_at)

-- Users
users (id, email, password_hash, name, created_at)

-- Donation items
items (id, user_id, category, brand, description, condition, quantity, estimated_value, created_at)
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Charity Search Must Include Personal Charities
The charity search is used in multiple places and MUST include personal charities:
1. **Donation form autocomplete** - initCharityAutocomplete() line 1827
2. **Search function** - searchCharities() line 1902
3. **Recent donations search** - filterDonations()
4. All must include `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header

### Categories (Ordered by prevalence)
1. Religion (96 in database)
2. Education (1,948)
3. Health (3,784)
4. Human Services (1,819)
5. Community (541)
6. Environment (102)
7. Arts & Culture (243)
8. International (202)
9. Research (113)
10. Other (1,151)

## Deployment Process
1. Code changes committed to GitHub
2. Auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages
3. Database migrations via Cloudflare D1 console

## Known Issues to Address
- Need DELETE endpoint for personal charities
- IRS charity lookup tool (external search) not implemented
- Export items functionality pending
- Date field positions need UI adjustment
- Timezone handling for crypto donations

## Test Accounts
- Admin: admin@example.com / admin123
- User: test@example.com / password123

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Personal charities searchable in all contexts
- ✅ Donation counts accurate
- ✅ Search/filter working properly
- ✅ Admin stats displaying correctly
- ✅ Charity verification functional
- ✅ Personal charity CRUD operations working

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Create DELETE API for personal charities
2. Implement IRS charity lookup (external search)
3. Add export functionality for donated items
4. UI improvements for date/time fields
5. Comprehensive timezone handling

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)
- Backend: Cloudflare Pages Functions (serverless)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- Auth: Custom JWT-like tokens
- Deployment: GitHub → Cloudflare Pages

## Important: Authentication Pattern
All API calls requiring user context must include:
```javascript
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
const token = user.token || localStorage.getItem('token') || 'test-token';

fetch('/api/endpoint', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
});
```

This ensures personal charities are included in search results.
