### Important Notes

#### Item Donations
- Items must match names in the 497 IRS-based valuations database
- Common items: Coat, Sweater, Jeans, Dress, Shirt, Pants, Shoes, etc.
- Fair condition = $0 (tracked but not tax deductible)
- Good, very_good, excellent = tax deductible values from database

#### Charity Matching
- Uses fuzzy matching and alias system
- Common aliases handled automatically (e.g., "Red Cross" â†’ "AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS")
- Unmatched charities can be created as personal charities
