# Charity Tracker Qwik - Continuation Prompt v2.3.37

## ✅ ITEM DONATION EDIT ISSUE RESOLVED!

After extensive debugging from v2.3.24 through v2.3.37, the item donation edit functionality is now working correctly.

## Root Cause
The error `D1_TYPE_ERROR: Type 'undefined' not supported for value 'undefined'` was caused by undefined values being passed to the database UPDATE statement. Specifically:
- `data.item_description` was undefined (not sent from client)
- `data.estimated_value` was undefined (not sent from client)

These fields were being accessed with `data.item_description || null` which returns `null` when the property exists but is falsy, but returns `undefined` when the property doesn't exist at all.

## The Fix (v2.3.37)
Changed the bind values for item donations in `/functions/api/donations/[id].js`:
```javascript
// Before (causing undefined):
donationType === 'items' ? (data.item_description || null) : null,
donationType === 'items' ? (data.estimated_value || amount || null) : null,

// After (always defined):
null,  // item_description - deprecated, items stored in donation_items table
donationType === 'items' ? amount : null,  // estimated_value - use total amount
```

## Current Working Features
✅ All donation types can be created, viewed, edited, and deleted:
- Cash donations
- Mileage donations
- Stock donations
- Crypto donations
- **Item donations** (including multi-item donations)

✅ Both system and personal charities work correctly

✅ CSV import works for all donation types

✅ Item donation editing allows changing:
- Item condition (affects calculated value)
- Item quantity
- Charity assignment
- Donation date

## Implementation Notes

### Item Donations Storage
- Main donation record in `donations` table stores aggregate data
- Individual items stored in `donation_items` table
- Fields: `donation_id`, `item_name`, `category`, `condition`, `quantity`, `unit_value`, `total_value`
- No `value_source` or `cost_basis` columns in production

### Item Value Calculation
- Values are calculated based on exact item names from the database
- Condition multipliers: poor (0%), fair (varies), good (100%), very_good (125%), excellent (150%)
- Item names must match exactly (e.g., "Blender - High End" not "Blender")

### Test Data Files
- `test_items_FINAL_CORRECT.csv` - Contains exact item names from database
- `test_exact_items.csv` - Simple test with 3 exact names

## Debugging Lessons Learned

1. **Check for undefined vs null**: JavaScript `||` operator doesn't help when property doesn't exist
2. **D1 database is strict**: Won't accept undefined values in bind parameters
3. **Server logs don't appear in browser**: Need to deploy with console.log for debugging
4. **Test with exact data**: Item names must match database exactly

## Outstanding Issues (from original v2.3.24)

### Filter Reset Issue
Filters may not reset properly when navigating - needs investigation
