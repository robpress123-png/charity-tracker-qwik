# Charity Tracker v2.0.2 - Continuation Prompt

## Current State: v2.0.0 → v2.0.1 Migration
**Date:** January 22, 2025
**Developer:** Assistant continuing from previous session
**User:** Rob Pressman

## Project Overview
Charity Tracker is a web application for tracking charitable donations and maximizing tax benefits. Built with Qwik framework, deployed on Cloudflare Pages with D1 (SQLite) database.

## Critical Infrastructure - DO NOT CHANGE

### Auto-Deployment Configuration
```bash
# WORKING - DO NOT MODIFY
git add -A && git commit -m "commit message" && git push origin main
# Auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub integration
# GitHub repo: https://github.com/robpress123-png/charity-tracker-qwik
```

### Project Structure

```

## Authentication System - WORKING
```javascript
// Token format: token-{userId}-{timestamp}
// Example: token-user123-1674389234
// Stored in localStorage, sent as Bearer token
```

## v2.0.0 Migration Requirements

### 1. New Database Schema
```sql
-- Existing tables remain mostly unchanged
-- Key change: Remove JSON from notes field
-- Add new donation_items table

CREATE TABLE donation_items (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(16)))),
    donation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    condition TEXT CHECK(condition IN ('excellent', 'very_good', 'good', 'fair')),
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    unit_value DECIMAL(10, 2),
    total_value DECIMAL(10, 2),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (donation_id) REFERENCES donations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_donation_items_donation_id ON donation_items(donation_id);
```

### 2. API Changes Needed

#### POST /api/donations
When donation_type = 'items':
1. Insert donation record with total amount
2. Insert individual items into donation_items table
3. Return both donation and items

#### GET /api/donations/{id}
When donation_type = 'items':
1. Fetch donation record
2. JOIN with donation_items to get items list
3. Return complete data structure

#### PUT /api/donations/{id}
When donation_type = 'items':
1. Update donation amount (sum of items)
2. Delete existing items from donation_items
3. Insert updated items list

### 3. UI Changes Required

#### Dashboard.html Updates
- Fix editDonation() to handle items properly
- Update viewDonationDetails() to display items from new table
- Modify donation form to handle items array properly
- Fix the items donation interface for better UX

## Features That MUST Continue Working

## Sample Data Requirements for v2.0.0

### REQUIRED: Generate CSV files for fresh database population

#### 1. **donations.csv** (MUST CREATE - 50+ donations)
```csv
Headers: id,user_id,charity_id,user_charity_id,donation_type,amount,date,notes
```
- **Total records:** 50-75 donations minimum
- **Date range:** 1/1/2025 to TODAY (spread evenly)
- **User:** All for user 'test@example.com' (user_id from auth)
- **Distribution:**
  - 20 cash donations ($25 to $2,500)
  - 10 items donations (total value from items table)
  - 8 stock donations ($500 to $5,000)
  - 7 mileage donations (10-500 miles @ $0.14/mile)
  - 5 crypto donations ($100 to $3,000)
- **Charities:** Mix of system charities (use charity_id) and personal (use user_charity_id)
- **Notes:** Realistic notes like "Year-end giving", "Spring cleaning donation", etc.

#### 2. **donation_items.csv** (MUST CREATE - for each items donation)
```csv
Headers: id,donation_id,item_name,category,condition,quantity,unit_value,total_value
```
- **Link to:** Each items donation in donations.csv
- **Items per donation:** 3-10 items
- **Categories:** Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, Books, Household, Toys, Sports
- **Conditions:** excellent, very_good, good (NO fair - not deductible)
- **Values:** Realistic thrift store values ($5-$500)
- **Examples:**
  - Winter Coat, Clothing, very_good, 1, 45.00, 45.00
  - Laptop Computer, Electronics, good, 1, 200.00, 200.00
  - Children's Books, Books, excellent, 15, 3.00, 45.00

#### 3. **user_charities.csv** (MUST CREATE - 5-10 personal charities)
```csv
Headers: id,user_id,name,ein,category,is_approved
```
- Local churches, schools, small nonprofits
- Mix of approved (1) and pending (0)
- Various categories to test filtering

## Known Issues to Fix in v2.0.0
1. Items donation edit functionality (main reason for v2.0.0)
2. Receipt upload still not implemented
3. PDF report generation not implemented
4. Email notifications not implemented
5. Bank integration not implemented

## Git Commit Convention
```bash
# Format: "v2.0.0: Description of changes"
git add -A && git commit -m "v2.0.0: Implement proper donation_items table" && git push origin main
```

## Environment Variables (via Cloudflare Dashboard)
- Database: D1 database bound as `DB`
- No other environment variables needed

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile: Needs responsive improvements

## Security Considerations
- SQL injection prevention via prepared statements
- XSS protection through proper escaping
- CSRF: Not implemented (needed)
- Rate limiting: Via Cloudflare
- HTTPS: Enforced by Cloudflare

## Performance Notes
- Current donation fetch: Gets ALL donations (up to 10,000)
- Should implement pagination in v2.1
- Database indexes needed on commonly queried fields

## Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial release
- v1.7.1-1.7.9: Bug fixes and UI improvements
- v1.8.0: Dropdown menus, view details, edit fixes
- v2.0.0: Proper relational design for items donations

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. **ALWAYS test auto-deployment after changes**
2. **NEVER change the authentication token format**
3. **ALWAYS update version numbers in all HTML files AND package.json**
4. **Database changes need migration scripts**
5. **Personal charities use user_charity_id, system charities use charity_id**

## Next Developer Actions for v2.0.0
1. Create database migration script
2. Update /api/donations endpoint for items handling
3. Fix dashboard.html items donation UI
4. Generate and import sample data
5. Test all functionality
6. Update version numbers everywhere
7. Deploy via git push
