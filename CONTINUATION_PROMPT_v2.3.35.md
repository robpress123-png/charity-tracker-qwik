# Charity Tracker Qwik - Continuation Prompt v2.3.35

## Previous Context from v2.3.24 - v2.3.34

The application has been through extensive debugging to fix item donation edit functionality. Through deployments v2.3.25 to v2.3.34, we've been addressing a persistent 500 error when editing item donations.

## Major Issues Discovered and Fixed

### 1. Item Names in Test Data (Fixed in v2.3.26)
- Test CSV files had simplified item names that didn't match the database
- Example: "Blender" instead of "Blender - High End"
- Created new test files with exact database names

### 2. Database Column Mismatches (Fixed progressively)
- **value_source column** (v2.3.27): Removed from INSERT statements - column doesn't exist
- **cost_basis column** (v2.3.32): Removed from UPDATE statements - not in production DB
- **ID generation for donation_items** (v2.3.27-v2.3.31): Multiple approaches tried

### 3. Variable Scoping (Fixed in v2.3.34)
- Error handler couldn't access variables defined in try block
- Moved variable definitions outside try block for proper scoping

## Current Status (v2.3.35)

### STILL BROKEN - Item Donation Edits
Despite all fixes, editing item donations still returns 500 error:
```
PUT https://charity-tracker-qwik.pages.dev/api/donations/[id] 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```
This indicates the API is crashing and returning Cloudflare's HTML error page instead of JSON.

### Working Features
- All other donation types (cash, mileage, stock, crypto) can be edited successfully
- Item donations can be CREATED successfully
- CSV import works for all donation types including items
- Personal and system charities both work for non-item donations

### Latest Debugging Efforts (v2.3.35)
Added extensive console logging with prefixes to track execution:
- `[PUT START]` - Entry point logging
- `[PUT AUTH]` - Authentication checks
- `[ITEMS UPDATE]` - Item update process
- `[ITEMS DELETE]` - Deletion of old items
- `[ITEMS INSERT]` - Insertion of new items
- `[ITEMS ERROR]` - Error details

## Key Implementation Details

### Item Donation Edit Simplification
For item donation edits, we simplified the UI:
- Users can only change condition and quantity
- No item search or selection needed
- Item names remain unchanged

### Database Schema Notes
The production database has these tables:
- `donations` - Main donation records (no cost_basis column)
- `donation_items` - Individual items (no value_source column initially)
- Fields that exist: donation_id, item_name, category, condition, quantity, unit_value, total_value

### API Endpoints
- `/api/donations/[id].js` handles GET, PUT, DELETE
- PUT operation updates donation record and replaces all donation_items

## Test Files Created
- `test_items_FINAL_CORRECT.csv` - Contains exact item names from database
- `test_exact_items.csv` - Simple test with 3 exact item names

## Next Steps to Debug

1. **Check Cloudflare Logs**: The HTML error response suggests a crash before our error handlers
2. **Verify Database Schema**: Ensure no other columns are being referenced that don't exist
3. **Test Locally**: Use wrangler dev to see full error output
4. **Check Response Headers**: Ensure proper JSON content-type is set

## Important User Feedback
- "Don't break the other donation types!" - Must maintain working functionality
- "We systematically tested donation types one at a time" - All work except items
- "We can edit other types of donations" - Confirming non-item edits work
- "Cost basis should not be there for item donations" - Led to fix in v2.3.32

## Filter Reset Issue (From Original v2.3.24)
Still pending investigation - filters may not reset properly when navigating
